      KNOWLEDGE AT YOUR <b>FINGERTIPS</b>
    </h1>

    <p>
      What Textpedia is can be be understood by considering a sample use case.
      <br />
      <br />
      Imagine for a moment that you're in a meeting with an important client and
      several other participants are present. The presenter or the client
      mentions a word, or phrase you have only the vaguest idea about.
      <br />
      <br />
      Because of the importance of this meeting you can't use your phone to
      research the keyword, but you know that if you don't make a note about it
      or something like that, the pressures of the day will probably cause you
      to forget. You'd really like to know what the keyword/phrase means so what
      do you do?
      <br />
      <br />
      You could...
      <br />
      <br />
      Make a reminder to yourself, imagine having to take a minute or so to
      covertly type out this reminder while the gist of the meeting passes you
      by. Not good! Trust in your memory to remember to check out the keyword at
      the end of the day. Even worse! Spend 10 seconds or less to type out the
      keyword/phrase and SMS it to Textpedia safe in the knowledge that when you
      check your mail at the end of the day, you'll have a nicely formatted
      preliminary report waiting for you. This allows you to decide whether or
      not you want to dig deeper into the subject. Awesome!
